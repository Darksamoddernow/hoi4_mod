 bramja.1.d:0 "\n\n\nWorrying reports are coming in from [From.GetNameDef], due to loss of faith in the leadership, draft evasion is on the rise. Can [From.GetLeader] still inspire his people?"
 bramja.1.a:0 "Hopefully this is handled before our enemies can use this to their advantage..."
 bramja.1.b:0 "Cowardice only leads to destruction..."
 bramja.2.t:0 "Social unrest reaches tipping point in [From.GetNameDef]"
 bramja.2.d:0 "\nThe cocktail of existing internal divides and increasing outside pressures, is starting to tear the [From.GetAdjective] nation apart from within. The [From.GetAdjective] [From.GetRulingParty] has to reverse the trend if they want to keep up in the current arms rat race."

 bramja.3.t:0 "Insurrection in [From.GetNameDef]!"
 bramja.3.d:0 "Little more than two decades ago, mutinies sprang up as the Great War seemingly endlessy condused the life spirit of nations. However the people who rose up often saw their countries defeated and rarely ended up better in the long run...\nIf the [From.GetAdjective] leadership doesn't stop this in its infancy, it might well mean the end of the war...and their nation"

 bramja.6.t:0 "General MacArthur has forcefully taken over the [From.GetAdjective] government!"
 bramja.6.d:0 "MacArthur and like minded generals have made use of the popular dissatisfaction caused by the fruitless sacrifices and the means used in the ongoing war.

 bramja.7.t:0 "General MacArthurs Putch!"
 bramja.7.d:0 "MacArthur and like minded generals have made use of the popular dissatisfaction caused by the fruitless sacrifices and the means used in the ongoing war. With promises of a swift victory, MacArthur led a putsch against [USA.GetLeader]s government.\nNotwithstanding the diminishing popular and military support for [USA.GetLeader] and his [From.GetRulingParty] government, they were still able to prevent MacArthurs takeover of the entire country. \n\nThe battle lines between MacArthurs forces and those of the government will cut right through families and the American nation, as former minor differences of opnion slowly turn into civil war..."

 bramja.8.t:0 "What with our allies?"
 bramja.8.d:0 "Now that general MacArthur has established his rule, we have decide what to do about our membership of [Root.GetFactionName]. Our allies have drawn, some even say manipulated, us into the war, thus many amongst our people and the leadership feel we should leave them to their fate, correcting the mistake of ending our policy of Isolationism. \n\nEven though this would leave us weaker in face of our enemies, it would further legitimize our rule, as we prove we stand by our propagated goals for taking over the government.\nOur allies have anyway proven to be an impediment to the conduct of the war which is not ours, we have little to loose."
 bramja.8.a:0 "America First!"
 bramja.8.b:0 "We need our allies, at least for now..."
 bramja.9.t:0 "MacArthur starts return to Isolationism!"
 bramja.9.d:0 "In line with his program, MacArthur started the return to Isolationism today, by officially declaring their aliances outside of the Western Hemisphere null and void. America fights alone, but also stands alone, for now..."

 bramja.10.d:0 "Going against the expectations, the newly appointed minister of war of [From.GetNameDef] has spoken publicly on their maintainance of commitments made to the their allies for the duration of the current war. \nGiven MacArthurs supporters mainly advocate for a return to isolationism, this can have consequences for his rule."

 bramja.11.d:0 "With the war against bolshevism in the east still ongoing and the invasion of our homelands, [SOV.GetNameDef] has instructed communists in our country to rise up. Our situation is becoming more and more precarious every day. We must act fast if we still want to prevent our destruction by enemies from without and within!"
 bramja.11.a:0 "Our lands are becoming mere bargaining chips to be used in the grand game of chess!"
 bramja.12.t:0 "\n\nCommunists revolt in [From.GetNameDef] as enemies close in"
 bramja.12.d:0 "\n\n\n\nWith the [Root.GetFactionName] still waging war against bolshevism in the east, while the [From.GetAdjective] homelands are being invaded, [SOV.GetLeader] has instructed [From.GetAdjective] communists to rise up.

 bramja.12.b:0 "The end of the [From.GetAdjective] puppet state is nigh"
 bramja.12.c:0 "It is time the [From.GetAdjective] choose who they want in charge!"
 bramja_13a_tt:0 "We will lose control over our subjects given our dire situation.\n If Manchuko feels it cannot survive without our support, they might choose to stay loyal to us.\n This will largely depend on how much of an immediate threat the Russians form to them." 
 bramja_13b_tt:0 "Does the exact same as the first option, but you will also declare war on all former subjects."
 bramja.13.t:0 "Rebellions in our overseas conquests!"
 bramja.13.d:0 "The Dai Nippon Teikoku is on the brink of the abyss. With the hated gaijin ever more constricting us like the snakes they are, our connections with the overseas parts of the empire are withering away. Our Asian \"brethren\" have made use of this situation to betray our cause and go their own way. Realistically we have little means to \"guide\" them back in our folds, even though these wayward nations are often weak and divided. What shall we do?"
 bramja.13.a:0 "Sayonara...?"
 bramja.13.b:0 "Tennoheika Banzai!!!"
 bramja.16.t:0 "Japanese sphere falling apart"
 bramja.16.d:0 "Most of the Japanese overseas allies and subjects have risen up against their former \"protector\". They cite the increasing oppressiveness of Nippon within the Sphere as their main reason. One leader of the formerly subjected nations formulated it as follows:\n\"The Japanese were supposedly freeing us from Western imperialism. However in the end they were worse as an antidote than the poison itself...\" The reason why this is happening now is obvious: with their navy mostly resting at the bottom of the sea, the [From.GetAdjective] overseas holdings had been cut off from the Home Islands. However this turns out, it will surely be a turning point in Asian history."
 bramja.16.a:0 "This chaos in the East won't help our cause!"
 bramja.16.b:0 "This not the end of the beginning anymore, but the beginning of the end!"
 bramja.16.c:0 "East or West, none are spared in the conflagration"
 bramja.17.t:0 "The Middle Kingdom..."
 bramja.17.d:0 "§B\"The Empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.\"§!\n\nSo it was written in China's most read book the \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" (Sānguó Yǎnyì). The book phrases a view common throughout the East, a philosophy which conceives history as circular, Ying & Yang, as the eternal self eating snake, the ever swinging pendulum, back and forth, never really moving. Westerners often grew up with the linear view of history, as if always working its way to a final climax (or rather a literal Apocalypse), as so it is taught by the Abrahamic Religions. Not surprisingly, this difference in worldview has been used by Westerners to explain and justify their superiority over the world, as this would lead to a more active, driven people who wouldn't accept their lot but would always strive for more...\nRecent events in China could prove the already battered beliefs of the West wrong. Recently the well known saying has been going over the lips markedly more throughout China, as adapted versions of the Chinese novel spread out from the North. The adaptions are well crafted, stressings the analogies between the present and the past. This is only one of many ways how  the idea spreads that \"the unity and prosperity  of the Chinese realm\" shall soon return, guided by the Mandate of Heaven."

 bramja.18.t:0 "...will rise from the ash or be forever extinguished?"
 bramja.18.d:0 "The last dark decennia, in which China sank away into the chaos of Unequal Treaties, warlords, revolutionaries and finally unrelenting invaders, does seem to be coming to an end. Today in [Root.Capital.GetName] it was announced in the proper ritualistic fashion, how [FROM.GetLeader] was crowned Emperor of all of China once more. The final defeat of China's existential threats by the [From.GetAdjective] armies, had proven to whom the Mandate rightfully belonged, just as it had before. \nThe [From.GetRulingParty] have proven to be excellent propagandists over the last decade, using the course of events of the last decennia until now to fit a story with only one possible conclusion, the Qing, and the Qing only can show the path for China to regain its place in the world, in the center of it! Even the most cynic Western colonialist or idealistic Chinese republicans, must at times doubt their cause, as [From.GetName] now likely is the  most developed, resource rich and well armed state left in the Middle Kingdom.\nWill the Chinese Empire stand and complete the cycle once more, showing the world the Middle Kingdom ìs to last forever? Or  will those who pursued the Middle Kingdoms demise enjoy final vindication?"
 bramja.18.a:0 "A century of lacking political shrewdness overcome, in few years? Perhaps, perhaps... that must mean something."
